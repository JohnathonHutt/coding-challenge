# Ambassador Coding Challenge

#### README

My current plan is to develop a full-stack solution to the challenge using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js). This will actually be my first full-stack application using this combination of technologies so I intend to attack the problem independently: as a frontend React application and as an independently hosted RESTful API - both of which will be stored in this directory in folders named client and server respectively. This approach will ideally optimize my chances of completing a fully functional/polished final project in the time frame allotted while providing fallback positions with either front-end or back-end challenges. It will allow me to begin developing both paths immediately rather than spending too much time up front planning file architecture and connectivity in the context of a Heroku deployment.

Stack choices:

ReactJS: React was chosen as it was designated as a preferred technology by Ambassador.

CSS: Plain CSS is generally my go to for styling - I do occasionally use bootstrap though and if extra time is available I may look into refactoring to SCSS - since it was listed as a preferred technology by Ambassador.

Node.js/Express/MongoDB: These technologies were chosen due to my personal familiarity. I am also experienced with Python but I have not used Django (although I would be interested in and excited to) so I thought it would be unrealistic to use this technology for the full-stack challenge.


In your repo, please include the following items in your README:

-	Description of the problem and solution.
-	Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end, full stack, or mobile.
-	Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architecture.
-	Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
-	Link to the hosted application (where applicable).

This will give us insight into how you approached the challenge.

## Show us your other projects! (optional)

If you have existing code that you would like to share, please follow these guidelines:

-	Include a link to the repository in the README file that is part of your coding challenge submission
-	A description of what the code does
-	If the repository has multiple contributors, please highlight the parts for which you were responsible
